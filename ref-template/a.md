## Capabilities

### Multi-language Support

Multi-language support is a crucial aspect of software development and design that enables applications to cater to diverse linguistic user bases. It involves implementing features and functionalities that allow users to interact with the application in their preferred language. This support typically includes translating text, adapting date/time formats, and handling linguistic nuances. By embracing multi-language support, developers can enhance accessibility, user satisfaction, and expand their global reach. It requires careful consideration of internationalization techniques, such as resource management, localization frameworks, and language-specific character encoding. Implementing multi-language support empowers applications to break language barriers and provide a more inclusive experience for users worldwide.

### Javascript frameworks support

Next.js is a powerful and popular JavaScript framework used for building scalable and performant web applications. It provides a seamless development experience by combining the best features of React with server-side rendering and static site generation. Next.js offers comprehensive support for server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and client-side routing, resulting in improved performance and SEO. It also integrates effortlessly with popular libraries and frameworks like TypeScript, GraphQL, and CSS-in-JS. With Next.js, developers can easily build modern web applications with a smooth development workflow, efficient server-side rendering, and excellent performance out of the box

### Function Instantiation

Edge Functions module allows you to instantiate serverless functions in your Edge Application at Azion, as well as set up conditions for its execution.

Available for Edge Application and Edge Firewall products. Once it runs serverless functions in our robust distributed network of Edge Nodes, it responds to events closer to the end user, ensuring greater scalability and availability.
