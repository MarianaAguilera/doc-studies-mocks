# Enhancing Data Management with Azion's Edge Storage
Unleash Scalability: Azion's Edge Storage


In the digital world, dealing with growing volumes of data while ensuring fast access and strong system performance can be demanding for developers. What if there's an easier way? What if you can use Object Storage at the edge of the network, gain benefits like low-latency access, scalability, cost predictability, and high availability, all without dealing with the complexities of classic storage systems?

In this article, we delve into Azion Edge Storage, an Object Storage solution designed to simplify the data management process and turbocharge your applications' performance.

## Leverage Object Storage at the Edge

Azion Edge Storage allows you to manage assets like images and files without getting entangled in infrastructure management intricacies. It helps to focus on creating innovative applications by overcoming any infrastructure roadblocks.

Key benefits include:

1. S3 Compatible API: This compatibility smoothens migration from other cloud storage systems that use S3 API, enabling the transition without altering the existing application code.
   
2. Scalability: Edge infrastructures provide unlimited scalability, liberating storage capacity restrictions. Adjust storage according to your needs.
   
3. Reliability: Ensure stable, consistent performance with the Edge.
   
4. Cost Predictability: Avoid unforeseen costs and keep data transfer expenditures within set budgets.

5. Serverless Architecture: This architectural approach promotes a practical application development model with a focus on simplicity and flexibility.
   
6. Avoid Vendor Lock-in: This flexibility supports strategic decision-making and encourages competitive pricing.
   
7. No More Egress Charge: With edge computing, data processing occurs closer to the origin, significantly reducing data transfer volumes to and from the central server. Thus, control the high egress charges typically associated with cloud services and cut down operational expenses.

## Setting Up and Streamlining Data Management

Edge Storage manages data via distinct objects, each contain:

- The data composing the object,
- Related metadata (such as media type and object size),
- An object key serving as the unique identifier.

### S3 API

Edge Storage is compatible with the S3 API. The credentials can be managed through the /s3-credentials endpoint. You can retrieve data on all S3 credentials registered with Azion, retrieve data on an S3 credential registered with Azion, create an S3 credential, and remove S3 credentials from the account.

You can use the credentials through S3cmd, the S3 API through the region endpoint https://s3.use-east-005.azionstorage.net/, or libraries related to S3 for your chosen programming language.

Here are examples of creating S3 credentials and configuring them in S3cmd:

vbnet
```vbnet
Creating S3 credentials to be used with Edge Storage:

curl --location 'https://api.azion.com/v4/storage/s3-credentials 
--header 'Accept: application/json' 
--header 'Authorization: Token xxxxxxx 
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' 
--data '{
"name": "My S3 Credential",
"capabilities": ["listAllBucketNames", "listFiles"],
"bucket": "my-bucket-name",
// expiration based on the timezone defined in RTM settings
"expiration_date": "2025-01-31T10:57:00"

}'
```

yaml
```yaml
Configuring your credentials in S3cmd: 

user@user ~ % s3cmd --configure
Enter new values or accept defaults in brackets with Enter.
Refer to user manual for detailed description of all options.
Access key and Secret key are your identifiers for Amazon S3. Leave them empty for using the env variables.
Access Key: [your-recently-created-access-key]
Secret Key:  [your-recently-created-secret]
Default Region....
S3 Endpoint [s3.amazonaws.com]: https://s3.use-east-005.azionstorage.net/
```

Once the capabilities are assigned to the S3 credential, you can access and manipulate objects through S3cmd.

### REST API

Azion provides REST API methods to store objects. You can create and modify buckets and their permissions and manage objects.

Creating a bucket and uploading a file, such as `src/index.html`, allows you to use object storage as the origin for a static edge application. You will have a complete working application you can access and manipulate.

### Azion CLI

Azion CLI also provides an alternative to initialize and deploy an application. Upon initialization of an application using the `azion init` command to deploy it to the edge, a bucket is created with the chosen project name, and the static application is stored in it.

### Azion Edge Functions Storage API

Azion Edge Storage can be accessed via the Edge Functions Storage API. This interface allows you to read and write data in the storage and its associated buckets.

You need to import the APIs inside your edge function, instantiate a new Storage object, and choose and implement the methods listed in the documentation to get started.

## Dataflow Insights

The user access process involves a simple pattern. The user accesses a domain in Azion Edge Platform, requesting a static object like a video. Depending on the edge application configuration, the request is processed and the object requested from Edge Storage. Once the static object is obtained, the edge application delivers the content to the user.

## Conclusion

By leveraging object storage technologies at the edge of the network, Azion Edge Storage not only offers scalability, high reliability, and predictable costs but also streamlines the development process. 

With streamlined data management using Azion's user-friendly REST API, CLI, and Edge Functions Storage API, developers can focus on pushing their applications' boundaries rather than dealing with infrastructure problems. With Azion Edge Storage, we are not merely overcoming data challenges; we are unlocking our data's immense potential to propel our edge applications into the future.
